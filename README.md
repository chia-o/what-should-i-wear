<h1>What Should I Wear?</h1>

<p>A project that will eliminate overthinking and uncertainty, helping me figure out what I should wear everyday. I built a distributed web scraper with Celery and Redis to parse outfit inspiration, color theory, and uses a weather API to generate a sample outfit when prompted. It also uses a KNN algorithm to pick outfits based on what others have worn or would wear in similar conditions.</p>
