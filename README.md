# what-should-i-wear

<h1>A project that will eliminate the overthinking and uncertainty in figuring out what I should wear everyday.</h1>
  
<p>I built a distributed web scraper with Celery and Redis to parse outfit inspiration, color theory, and uses a weather API to generate a sample outfit when prompted. It also uses a KNN algorithm to pick outfits based on what others have worn or would wear in similar conditions. The frontend is built with React.</p>

<p>Hosted on AWS.</p>
