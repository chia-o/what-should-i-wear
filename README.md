# what-should-i-wear

<h1>A project that will eliminate the overthinking and uncertainty in figuring out what I should wear everyday.</h1>

<p>The user inputs an activity and their location, and using the OpenWeather API and pre-trained CNN models, outputs a sample outfit for me to wear</p>

<p>It's built on a Flask backend and displayed with a React frontend. It'll be hosted on AWS S3.</p>
